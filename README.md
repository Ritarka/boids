# Boids!

Inspired by this Sebestian Lague [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw). With some help from this [website](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Animal_Movement/Boids-algorithm.html).

Boids is a program that demonstrates the way birds in a flock or fish in a school move together.
